        <p>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the great leader and founder of Pakistan. He was known for his strong
            principles, clear thinking, and firm decisions. Quaid-e-Azam believed that a decision should be made only
            after careful and deep thinking, but once a decision was taken, it should be followed with complete
            determination and unity. His famous quote, “Think a hundred times before you take a decision, but once that
            decision is taken, stand by it as one man,” reflects his strong leadership and unwavering commitment. This
            quality of leadership played a vital role in the creation of Pakistan.</p>
